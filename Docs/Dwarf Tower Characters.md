# Dwarf Tower Characters

# Sniper

LMB – Levelwide laser that phases in after a short delay. Locks him in place

RMB – Trap that roots an enemy caught in it for a short while

SPACE – Bush that he can hide in, spawns at his location

# Mech Generator

Based on that one character I’m thinking of writing a story about.

LMB – Randomly spawn mech piece around him. After a short delay, it spawns, hitting enemies it lands on. He can go to it and pick it up.

RMB – Tractor beam: pulls all shots (ally and enemy) toward him

SPACE – Dive: dashes in a direction, and then takes some time to recover

When he collects enough mech pieces, he is presented with a menu, giving me three options for a mech to build.

## Tracer Mech

Light and Fast, but only takes one hit

LMB – Standard Shot

RMB – Radial burst

SPACE – Teleport to cursor (not a dash)

## Lancer Mech

Medium weight, medium mobility

LMB – Dual rapid-fire

RMB – Short-range laser (instant cast, locks him in place for a bit)

Space – Generates pull point at cursor (does no damage). While moving toward a pull point, allies move faster. If an ally stops, the pull point will continue pulling them, even when in a move that would prevent them from manually moving.

## Boulder Mech

Heavy mech and packs a punch, high HP, but no mobility

LMB – Quad missiles

RMB – Medium-range Heavy duty laser (instant cast, locks him in direction and movement for a few seconds)

SPACE – Shield that drains amina

# Stonicorn

Basically Merky from Stonicorn. Can be unlocked by using Unicorn to hit a teleport shot with a teleport shot.

PASSIVE – Stone. Cannot move with WASD, only by using the Teleport ability

PASSIVE – Petrified: Cannot move or use abilities while another player is looking at it. Does not Stand (contest the caravan) while Petrified.

PASSIVE - Invincible. If it would take damage, it teleports to a random location on the map instead.

LMB – Earth quake: Every object in the area takes damage over time

RMB – Ability Orb: Drains amina from enemies and grants it to allies

SPACE - Teleport (Swaps with objects it teleports onto)

# Commander

A commander Dwarf with combat experience. He can rally the troops and tell them where to go, even without player voice comms.

LMB – Bombshell. Click a position, and 0.5 seconds later, it will be hit with a bombshell, damaging everything at that position. Costs amina.

RMB – Rally Flag. Click a position to spawn a flag there, placing a map marker for all allies. Allies moving toward the flag get a movement speed boost, and allies within the flag’s rally radius also receive a movement speed boost (does not stack). Commander gains amina over time for each ally within the flag’s rally radius. Repositioning the flag does not cost amina. Commander loses amina over time for each enemy within the flag’s rally radius. The flag can be placed on an enemy, which causes the flag to lock on and follow the enemy.

SPACE – Command Mode. Toggle on and off. While in Command Mode, Commander is rooted and surrounded by a protective bunker that protects him from incoming shots. While in this mode, Commander can also move his camera around the entire map. Command Mode does not cost amina upfront and does not cost amina per second. Whenever the bunker is hit, it consumes amina. If Commander runs out of amina or reloads his amina, he is forced out of Command Mode. Whenever Commander exits Command Mode, the bunker disappears. If Commander is stunned while in Command Mode, he is forced out of it.

SPACE – Command Mode. Press to enter Command Mode. Press again to exit. While in Command Mode, Commander is rooted and enclosed in a bunker that protects him from incoming shots. Command Mode does not cost amina per second, but it does cost a lot of amina up front. Whenever the bunker is hit, it consumes amina to heal itself. It can heal itself each second in chunks. If the bunker breaks, Commander is forced out of Command Mode. If Commander is stunned while in Command Mode, the bunker is auto-destroyed. Commander can run out of amina and reload while in Command Mode without being forced out of it.

By using his Rally Flag to guide his teammates, he also gains amina per second, that he can use to stay in Command Mode. If played right, he can sit in a far off corner of the map and effect the battle from afar.

# Furry

Inspired by the game Fury. A sword wielder that parries attacks to make counter attacks.

LMB – Wide Swipe. Swipes in an area around him. Tap to instantly attack with a smaller range and higher amina cost. Hold and release for a larger range and lower amina cost. While holding, Furry is rooted.

RMB – Poke Strike. Dashes and slashes in a direction. Tap to instantly move and attack with a smaller range and higher amina cost. Hold and release for a longer range and lower amina cost. While holding, Furry is not rooted, but his Poke Strike attack direction is locked.

SPACE – Parry. Hold to block with his sword. Costs a small amount of amina per second. If a shot hits the sword, it gives him amina and deflects in his looking direction (like how Genji from Overwatch deflects projectiles). The shot does not change teams; it is still deadly to him and his allies. This means a careless (or malicious) Furry can Parry a shot into a teammate and get them stunned. He can Parry while charging Wide Swipe or Poke Strike. Furry can Parry even if he runs out of amina.

R – Nothing. He is unable to reload. If he runs out of amina, he has to parry shots.

Furry’s abilities don’t do a lot of damage, so he’s not good against obstacles or constructs. However, since his abilities attack in an area, he’s good at stunning multiple enemies at once. His abilities limit his movement, but he can Parry while charging them to keep himself safe.

# Wizard

LMB – Fireball. Launch a fireball projectile with large size and high damage, but that shrinks and loses damage the further out it goes towards its max range. If it hits something, it does its damage on impact, then sets the target on fire for 1 second. It has 10 hp, and loses hp over time. The more hp it has, the bigger its size and the more damage it does.

RMB – Lightning ball. Press to make a ball of lightning at the target location, instantly. It does 0 damage. It has 1 hp and loses hp overtime. When it dies, it pulls in everything in its range towards its location: allies, enemies, ally shots, enemy shots, obstacles, etc.

RMB – Lightning. Send an arc of lightning instantly to any position and any target, including enemies. All movable objects near the target get magically drawn into the target, including shots (ally and enemy), allies, enemies, trees, boulders, turrets, barricades, etc. The only thing immune to the pull-in effect is the caravan and the border wall (yes, even the Wizard himself can be pulled in if close enough). Lightning does no damage.

SPACE – Magic Shield. Press to make a circular Magic Shield at the cursor position. Magic Shield can block 1 damage. The main target the inside Magic Shield is rooted and cannot take any damage while in the Magic Shield. If anything touches the Magic Shield, it breaks. This means that the Wizard’s own Fireball and Lightning abilities can break them. Lightning has a bolt that goes from the Wizard to the ball of lightning. This bolt can also break Magic Shield. Also, if a player or object with amina is inside the Magic Shield, the Magic Shield slowly gives them amina overtime. This is to prevent characters like Unicorn from getting stuck in a Magic Shield for the entire match.

SPACE – Magic Shield. Press to make a circular Magic Shield at the cursor position, and hold to keep it there. It blocks enemy shots. It does not move with the cursor. While active, Wizard’s other spells get cast from the Magic Shield’s position instead. Magic Shield costs amina over time. When the Magic Shield takes damage, it consumes the Wizard’s amina.

Status Effect: On Fire. When an entity is On Fire, it takes 1 damage for every 1 complete second it’s on fire. If it gets close to another entity or another entity gets close to it, it sets that other entity On Fire for 1 second. If the entity is stunned or destroyed while On Fire, it launches four fireballs (one in each cardinal direction). These fireballs are the same kind that the Wizard fires with his Fireball ability.

The Wizard can do massive damage when enemies are close to together with his Fireball, and he has his Lightning to make it more likely they will be close together. He has the ability to hold it all for later. He can bottle his Fireball and Lightning spells in a Magic Shield, and then release them all at once when necessary.

# Warlock

Warlock has 10 hp. His amina is tied to his hp. He actually doesn’t have amina, conventionally. He uses his own hp as amina. When he casts spells, he uses amina, which also decreases his hp. When he gets hit, he loses hp and amina. When he reloads, he gains back hp. If he ever runs out amina (ex: by using abilities), then his hp goes to 0 and he becomes stunned. Because of the mechanics involved, I think he needs to be able to cancel his reload ability at any point during the process.

LMB – Magic Missile

RMB – Health Bomb. Hold to charge up more hp and damage for the bomb. It moves slowly, but when it dies, it explodes into a number of shots based on its max hp. Also, whenever it takes damage, it launches a shot.

SPACE – Shout. While shout’s duration is still going on, nearby projectiles have increased damage and movement speed.

LMB – Triple shot, IDK.

RMB – Burst Triple shot. One large projectile that splits into three after getting destroyed. IDK.

SPACE – Fear cloud. Large projectile that moves slowly over the map. Enemies inside move slower. IDK.

# Mimic

In order for this to work, there needs to be treasure chests around the map. Otherwise everyone’s going to know the chest is always a mimic and never fall for it.

LMB – Attack. Hits in the looking direction

RMB – Mimic. Assumes the form of the object closest to the crosshair.

SPACE – Eat. Destroys the target object in range and assumes its form and position.

Ok on second thought, maybe the mimic would work regardless if there’s chests or not. It sounds really complicated to program tho. Im concerned that maybe this character would not be fun to play, but I think that maybe it would be. Then the only thing is that this might be hard to implement.

# Sigil Carver

She’s the one who wrote the permanent sigils on the caravan. But in game, she only has time for temporary sigils in the dirt.

LMB – Standard Shot

RMB – Sigil Menu. Hold to the sigil’s button in the menu to draws a sigil on the ground. The longer the hold time, the longer the range of the sigil, and the higher the upfront cost. Each sigil effects everything inside it, whether ally or enemy. Sigils are temporarily drawn in the dirt, so if any player walks over it, it destroys it. Each sigil has a range of effect, inside which it effects all entities, including players, objects, and shots. Sigils cost amina upfront, and they also cost amina overtime. If Sigil Carver ever runs out of amina, her sigils disappear. If she gets stunned, her sigils don’t get wiped, unless she runs out of amina while stunned. If the caravan enters a sigil’s radius, that sigil is immediately destroyed.

Sigil 1 – Invulnerability. Entities take no damage

Sigil 2 – Immovability. Entities cannot be forced to move against their will (rooting still works)

Sigil 3 – Hot Touch. Entities deal damage to things that touch them

SPACE – Absorption Cloak. Cloaks herself. Costs amina over time. If she gets hit, she gains amina instead of being hit. Does not work if she has no amina (She is able to reload, unlike Furry).

# Sigiil Carver V2

2023-12-28

LMB – Standard Shot

RMB – Sigil Lines / Sigil Menu. Hold to draw a chalk line at the cursor position (in range). Make an enclosed area with the chalk line to make a completed chalk area.

SPACE – Absorption Cloak. Hold to cloak and block damage. Getting hit costs amina.

While in an empty completed chalk area, the controls change to the Sigil Menu.

LMB – Invulnerability Sigil. Entities in the chalk area take no damage.

RMB – Immovability. Entities in the chalk area cannot be moved against their will (rooting still works).

SPACE – Hot Touch. Entities in the chalk area deal damage to things that touch them.

Sigils last indefinitely. Sigils take no damage. However, if a player walks over a sigil, or an object is created on top of a sigil, that sigil is destroyed. An enemy can destroy a chalk line segment by walking into it. A sigil whose chalk area has been disrupted still remains, but is then inactive until the chalk area is enclosed again.

# Zayan

Based on Goku from Dragon Ball Z.

R – Charge amina. Can overcharge basically indefinitely to get multiple layers of amina charges. Each layer has 100 amina. Has 1 hp per amina layer, minimum of 1 hp. If gets hit while charging, loses all amina in addition to getting stunned.

LMB – Rapid punch. Roots Zayan and locks his look direction. Deals 1 damage every 0.1s to everything in the hit area. Hold to keep punching. Release to stop punching. Punch rate increased based on charge. Costs amina overtime while holding.

RMB – Kome-Taha. Hold to charge a laser for 0.5 seconds, then release a giant beam that deals damage over time. Hold to keep it going, it deals damage every frame. It deals more damage and is wider based on current charge. Locked in place while holding. Look direction is not locked, but it moves slower towards the cursor.

SPACE – Teleport to cursor. Has limited range, but range increased based on charge. Instant cast. Flat amina cost per teleport, not based on range.

# Ghost

Based on the ghosts from PacMan.

PASSIVE – Pellets. Instead of requiring amina, Ghost and his ghostlings drops amina pellets while using an ability. Both allies and enemies can pick up amina pellets to gain a bit of amina. Every 10th pellet he drops will be a super pellet instead. Super pellets grant more amina than regular pellets, but also make Ghost and his ghostlings enter blue mode for a few seconds.

PASSIVE – Ghost. Can pass through all objects, players, and shots, without getting hit. If he passes through an enemy, he hits that enemy, and causes them to lose all their amina.

LMB – Unrest. Spawns a super pellet at the cursor location. After a delay, spawns a ghostling at the cursor position that chases the player closest to the cursor. If there is no player in range of the cursor, it wonders around its spawn position. Ghostlings run away from the closest player while in blue mode.

RMB – Ghost cage. Creates a giant white rectangle centered around the cursor. Anyone attempting to leave the rectangle gets teleported to the other side. This works like the maze in PacMan where you can teleport between the left and right sides. Press to activate, press again to deactivate. When activated, it spawns a super pellet at the center of the rectangle. If Ghost gets stunned, Ghost cage auto-deactivates.

SPACE – Creep. Hold to make Ghost and his ghostlings Stealthed.

## Blue Mode

While in blue mode, Ghost and his ghostlings turn blue, move slower, can’t use abilities, can’t stun, and drop pellets. They also lose their ghost passive. If an enemy hits a ghostling, that ghostling disappears. If an enemy hits Ghost, he gets stunned.

# Pirate

Pirate might have 3 hp.

LMB – Blunderbuss. Large shot that splits into three smaller shots, which in turn each split into three regular shots.

RMB – Hook. Sends his hook out to a position. If it hits a player, it force drags the player to Pirate’s position and steals the target’s amina. Can also be used to grab an artifact or holdable item. I think it might also be able to steal dwarf turrets and other placeable objects.

SPACE – Powder keg. Rolls a powder keg in the looking direction. It has 10 hp. Whenever it collides with something, it loses 1 hp (in addition to taking damage from shots). When it loses all hp, it explodes into lots of regular shots in all directions. And it launches objects in its radius away from the blast point. Additionally, while rolling, it leaves a small wake that increases ally’s movement speed.

# Sir Tray

Talked about him before. Inspired by Tracer from Overwatch.

LMB – Triple spray. Rapidly sprays shots in groups of 3.

RMB – Radial spray. Rapidly sprays eight shots, one in each direction.

SPACE – Teleport. Teleports a fixed distance in the movement direction.

Pretty standard character. Most likely to be one of the first unlocked by default. Has some lore ties to Unicorn. He had a steed who was a unicorn. When he died, he gave Sir Tray his unicorn horn, which Sir Tray now uses to teleport.

# Rock Golem

Inspired by Bastion from Overwatch and Stone Spirit from Autochess.

PASSIVE – Heavy. Locked in place while firing.

LMB – Pebbling Gun. Fires small stones rapidly, with a projectile speed higher than usual.

RMB – Skipping stones. Launches stones with a zigzag pattern of movement.

SPACE – Stone Sanctuary. If there are no stones near it, create 4 stones around it. These stones are neutral and block both ally and enemy damage. If there are stones near it, it instead destroys all stones around it, gaining amina per stone destroyed, and the hp of the stone. Activates only on button down.

# Angel

This character watches from above, but can’t directly interfere in the battle. Angel passes through all objects, players, and shots without getting hit and without hitting anything. Cannot reload amina. Gains amina for each ally within Guiding Light.

PASSIVE – Guiding Light. Shines an AoE light around the cursor. Allies within the Guiding Light receive amina per second, and recover from being stunned 2x faster. Does not cost amina.

LMB – Divine Sanction. Click on an ally shot to increase its size and damage. Click on an enemy shot to decrease its size and damage. Does not stack if a shot is clicked multiple times.

RMB – Healing Rays. Click on an ally to heal 1 hp (if they even have more than 1 max hp). Click on a stunned ally to help them come out of stun 1 second faster.

SPACE – Guardian Angel. Teleports to the ally at the cursor position and follows them. Does not cost amina. If no ally at cursor position, teleports anyway, and returns movement control to player. This ability is more quality of life for the Angel player than an actual ability.

# Emperor Tree

A unique tree that slowly takes over the board. It’s basically like playing a 4X or RTS game.

WASD – Move camera. The first tree spawns at your team’s flag. This is where your empire starts.

PASSIVE – Circle of Life. When a player (ally or enemy) is stunned in range of one your trees, you gain amina. You cannot gain amina by reloading.

LMB – Seed shot. If it doesn’t hit anything and lands at its destination, it will be planted. After a set duration, it’ll grow into a tree, a lot like the original tree. Has a limited range.

RMB – Fruit shot. If it doesn’t hit anything and lands at its destination, it will become collectible. If a living non-tree player picks up the fruit, they gain a small amount of amina, 1 hp (but not max hp), and a temporary passive: When they get stunned, they plant a seed at the stun location and you gain some amina. The fruit shot also has a limited range, but can be picked up and carried by another player to make the effective range basically infinite.

SPACE – Embarken. Click on a tree of yours to heal 1 hp and increase its max hp by 1.

R – Root Attack. Hold to make the tree under your cursor do a Root Attack. All players within range of the that range become rooted. As soon as you release, the Root Attack ends and the rooted players are free to go. If you move your cursor while holding, it changes to whatever tree is currently under the cursor. Only one tree of yours can do a Root Attack at a time. Costs amina per second.

I imagine that each tree you control would count towards the player total needed for Commander’s player count and Angel’s player count. And that you would receive amina per second for each tree in Angel’s Guiding Light.

# Thunderbird

Bird of the weather.

LMB – Rain droplets. Fires a spray of three rain droplets. If they collide with each other, they combine into a bigger shot with more hp and more damage. They get an increase of +1 damage and +1 hp every time they combine, in addition to combining their stats. Rain droplets also power up other ally shots.

RMB – Hail balls. Big damage. When it dies, it explodes into four icicles, one in each cardinal direction.

SPACE – Maelstrom. Makes a circle around him that sucks in shots into its orbit. When he lets go, it sends them flying away from him. Does not transfer control. Costs amina per second

# Zombie

Has 5 hp and moves slowly.

PASSIVE – Horde. When Zombie gets stunned or Zombie stuns a player, a zombie spawns at the location where that player was hit. Zombie controls all other zombies. When a regular zombie dies, a regular zombie spawns at a random location on the map.

LMB – Cough. Coughs up a short-range blood spot that stays on the ground if it doesn’t hit anything.

RMB – Brain pickup. Spawns a brain at the cursor location. All zombies automatically move towards the closest brain. Allies and enemies can pick it up to instantly refill all amina. However, doing so gives them the scent of brain, making zombies move towards them. Players lose the scent of brain when they get stunned.

SPACE – Sacrifice. Sacrifice the zombie closest to the cursor. When it respawns at a random location on the map, it respawns with increased level.

Level 1 Zombie – Standard. Moves slowly. 1 damage, 5 hp.

Level 2 Zombie – Runner. Moves really fast. 1 damage, 2 hp.

Level 3 Zombie – Hunk. Moves normal speed. 5 damage, 10 hp. Unlike other zombies, does not navigate around obstacles, and instead chooses to destroy everything in its path. This makes hiding behind the caravan a good option.

## Adendum 2021-01-14

Zombie spawns in with the Brain object, that can be held like other items. RMB throws the brain to target location. The player that holds the Brain gains amina over time, but also attracts the zombies. If you hold RMB while not holding it, it creates a map marker that shows you where it is. The map marker goes away after you release RMB. Like other items, a player drops the Brain when they get stunned. RMB also throws the current held item, if Zombie is holding any item, even those that are not the Brain.

Sacrificing a Level 3 Zombie increases Zombie’s Level by 1 until he gets stunned.

# Bard

Each ability button is a note he can play that affects him and his allies. The longer he holds the note or spams it, the less effective it becomes. Playing other notes makes the effect recover. Thus, it’s optimal to play a song with multiple notes instead of one note over and over again. He doesn’t consume amina at all, nor does he actually shoot or do any damage

LMB – Damage boost. Allies increase fire rate, and ally shots do more damage.

RMB – Healing. Heals allies by 1 hp per note and does the same for everything in the area, including ally constructs and shots, and neutral obstacles (but not enemy players or objects).

SPACE – Movement speed boost. Allies and ally shots move faster.

RELOAD – Amina regen. Grants allies a bit of amina.

There may also be specific multi-note songs that have a particular effect.

# Thief

Gets in, grabs loot, gets out.

LMB – Grabby hands. Reaches out in the cursor direction, and claims whatever ally or enemy object it comes into contact with. The object is held above his head until he lets go of it. Control is passed to him. The object is still active while he’s holding it, in that it can damage and can take damage. Can only carry one thing at a time. Cannot launch other abilities while holding an object, but can activate smoke cannister and grappling hook while holding something.

RMB – Smoke cloud. Throws smoke cannister shot in the cursor direction. at cursor location. If it reaches its destination, it While active, press RMB again to unleash a cloud that makes him invisible and drains the amina of enemies inside. Because of this, can only have one cannister out at a time, but can have many smoke clouds on the field at a time.

SPACE – Grappling hook. Press to send it in the cursor direction. When it hits something, it stops. While it’s out, hold to pull Thief out to the hook’s location. Does not drag him through solid objects. Stop holding to stop pulling Thief. Hook lasts until destroyed. Thief can destroy his grappling hook by hitting it with a Smoke cloud cannister.

# Vampire

Unable to restore amina by reloading. Must drain it from others.

Vampire Form:

LMB – Blood shots. Three thin shots that move faster than normal shots. Hitting targets restores amina.

RMB – Blood suck. Hold to continually activate. If an enemy is under the crosshairs, drain amina from them to restore your own amina. If this would cause the enemy to run out of amina, that enemy becomes stunned.

SPACE – Teleport.

R – Transform. Two modes: Vampire form, Bat horde form. When switching to bat form, uses up all remaining amina. The number of bats created is proportional to the amina spent. When he runs out of bats, he becomes stunned and returns to vampire form. When switching to vampire form, destroys all bats and grants amina proportional to the number of bats destroyed in this way.

Bat Form:

PASSIVE – Buddy System. When a bat kills something, another bat spawns.

LMB – Solo attack. Send a bat out to a location. After it gets there, it comes back to the horde. If the last bat gets sent out, it returns to its starting location, and “rejoins”. If a bat would return but there are no more bats in the horde, it returns to its starting location. There is no fire delay for this attack, but you do have to press down the button each time you want to send out a bat.

RMB – Wing attack. Each bat grows twice as big while holding, then returns to normal size when you let up. This ability lets you convert near-misses into hits.

SPACE – Scatter. All bats in the horde fly in all directions a fixed distance, then return to their starting location.

RELOAD – Switch to Vampire form. When switching to vampire form, destroys all bats and grants amina proportional to the number of bats destroyed in this way.

# Rogue

Operates in the shadows.

PASSIVE – Sense. When an enemy uses an ability in a certain range around you (that probably extends off screen), a mapmarker appears to you to show you their location.

LMB – Shuriken shot. Hold to charge, let go to release. The longer you hold, the faster the shuriken travels, up to a maximum speed. Shurikens have 5 hp and can block other shots.

RMB -

SPACE – Dark Cloud. Spawns a dark cloud at her location and the cursor location. Then teleports to the cursor location. Dark clouds only spawn at positions where there is no dark cloud. Teleporting between dark clouds costs no amina, but spawning a dark cloud costs amina upfront for each dark cloud created.

# Arsenal

Has lots of explosive weapons. Everyone of them deals damage in an area, and knocks back things that don’t die.

LMB – Heat seeking missile. Seeks towards closest player. Explodes on contact, dealing damage in an area.

RMB – Stored missiles. Hold to build up a barrage of missiles. Release to launch all missiles, which navigate toward target location, and explode on arrival, dealing damage in an area.

SPACE – Mine. Press to lay a mine near your location (like Sniper trap). When something hits it, it explodes, dealing damage in an area. This has lots of knockback, allowing you to hit it yourself to get launched a distance enough to dodge attacks.

# Stone Spirit

Stones close enough to you orbit around you, blocking damage and dealing damage. Stone Spirit has more than 1 health and has lower than average move speed.

LMB – Launch stone to target location. Can damage things while it’s traveling.

RMB – Retract stones. Hold to pull stones towards you. Works on environmental boulders and rocks you summon. If a stone touches you, it gets pulled into orbit.

SPACE – Conjure boulder. Looks just like an environmental boulder. Costs lots of amina.

# Lightning Spirit

Uses electricity to control the flow of amina.

PASSIVE – Amina syphon. Drain amina from enemies near you over time, granting you amina. Stand near allies to give them your amina over time.

PASSIVE – Ethereal. Cannot be damaged. If you run out of amina, your HP goes to 0. When you stop being stunned, your amina goes to 10%. You cannot gain amina from reloading. Has 0.1 HP, so it is not good at pushing the caravan.

LMB – Lightning strike. Create a lightning bolt between you and all nearby static shots. If there are static shots near those static shots, it strikes between them too.

RMB – Static shot. An electric shot that sticks to the first object it hits. The static syphons amina from nearby enemies and neutrals (that have amina) over time, and stores it. If you or an ally stand next to it, it gives them the amina over time. If you or an ally are near another static shot within range of this static shot, it gives its amina to that static shot near you or an ally over time (the amina flow chains between static shots). When not gaining amina or giving amina, static shots auto-drain their amina overtime, and when they lose all amina, they die. Static shots can latch onto allies and ally objects as well. When its target dies (HP == 0), the static shot also dies.

SPACE – Spark Jump. Press to jump to the closest static shot in the target direction.

LMB – Amina drain. Hold to drain amina of enemies around you. Does damage over time, maybe like 5 seconds of continual drain does 1 hp of damage.

RMB – Lightning ball. Make lightning ball that moves t

SPACE – Teleport. Press to teleport a short distance.

# Mountain Lion

A wild cat that preys on unsuspecting trespassers.

LMB – Claw swipe. Press to jump forward a little to swipe at things close to you in front of you. Also damages shots it hits, allowing you to protect yourself from spam.

RMB – Pounce. Hold to crouch and go into stealth, even in the open. Move slowly while holding. Release to jump forward in the target direction, moving further the longer you were in stealth. Deal damage where you land.

SPACE – Run. Increase movement speed.

# Alchemist

Brews potions while stationary. These potions do a lot during battle. Can use potions while moving.

## Stationary

The brewing pot shows up and your buttons put potions in the pot. When three ingredients are put in the pot, you get a potion in your inventory. The potion’s color is determined by the last ingredient in the potion.

LMB – Hydrogen peroxide (D). Damages 1 HP when drank per ingredient stack.

RMB – Aloe vera (H). Heals 1 HP when drank per ingredient stack.

SPACE – Ethanol (S). Increases movement speed for a set duration when drank. Duration increased per ingredient stack.

Potions

## While Moving

LMB – Throw current potion. Press once to throw current potion. It moves to the target location and stays there.

RMB – Next potion. Press once to put the current potion at the back of the queue, and make the next potion the current potion. The current potion is held on your character like artifacts or Astral’s weapons.

SPACE – Dash.

## Potions

When potions are throw and/or land at their target location, they can be picked up by you, allies, and enemies. When you have a potion on you (like artifacts or Astral’s weapons), you have the following controls to activate the potion.

SPACE – Drink.

# Dragon

A giant character that has lots of HP and is really hard to kill. It’s going to be really hard to find probably.

It has 50 HP and passively generates HP every second. When it dies, it gets stunned for a lot longer than most characters. It has a body that can be damaged, but also has a tail and wings that can’t be damaged. The wings guard the sides while idle. When you are reloading your amina, your wings extend forward, exposing your sides. Dragon moves slowly on the ground.

LMB – Flame breath. Breathes lots of tiny fireballs in front of it. Each fireball does the normal thing that fire does in the game, catching things on fire and all. While using this ability, wings are extended to the side, exposing the sides of the dragon.

RMB – Fireball. Press to launch a fireball that travels until it hits something. Is also on fire.

SPACE – Fly. Press to leave the map and fly. Leave a shadow on the ground under your position. You move incredibly faster while flying. Press again to stop flying. After a delay, you land where your shadow is, dealing massive damage. Costs amina over time and costs 100% of amina when you land.

# Gopher

Tunnels under the ground to make moving around easier for you and teammates. Does not gain amina normally.

LMB – Dirt shot. Basically a standard shot, but with a limited range.

RMB – Pickaxe. Deals high damage in a small area in melee range. If it doesn’t hit anything, it leaves a hole and grants you amina. Holes drastically reduce enemy movement speed while they walk over the hole. When an enemy leaves the hole’s area of effect, the hole is filled in.

SPACE – Tunnel. Goes underground and moves slower while digging a tunnel. Makes a hole on mouse down and on mouse up. If you press SPACE on an existing hole that has a tunnel attached, you automatically move through the tunnel to the other end. The holes created by this ability slow enemies in the same way as the Pickaxe ability. If a hole with a tunnel is destroyed, the tunnel is also destroyed, and the other hole becomes a normal hole with no tunnel.

If you or an ally press SPACE over an existing hole that has a tunnel, they travel quickly through the tunnel to the other end. While traveling, you cannot use abilities. You might be able to reload though. While traveling, all damage over time effects are paused.

# Necromancer

Resurrects things that have died.

LMB – Bone throw. Press to throw a bone, that travels to target location and breaks. Skeletons move towards the place the bone broke.

RMB – Summon skeleton. Press to summon a skeleton at the target location after a delay. Skeletons deal damage in a small area when they arrive. Skeletons have low HP but high speed. They auto-attack the closest enemy or neutral thing with HP.

SPACE – Dash. Press to move a short distance in target direction.

# Lumberjack

Cuts down trees, plants trees, and builds stuff. When he damages a tree, gain 1 wood, or wood equal to the damage dealt if more than 1. Constructing an object costs 1 wood. Planting a seed costs 1 wood. Space still rolls if you have no wood, but does not plant the seed. RMB still opens construction menu if you have no wood, but any button press would cause it to exit the menu. Constructing objects costs wood but not amina.

LMB – Axe throw. Axes curve towards cursor after thrown.

RMB – Open construction menu.

SPACE – Seed Roll. Leave a seed in your original location, which grows into a tree overtime.

## Construction Menu

LMB – Wall. Blocks enemy shots and movement.

RMB – Floor. Prevents terraforming on that location. If any other player tries to terraform over the floor, their ability gets canceled.

SPACE – Chair. Players that stop on it charge amina over time. Spawns a chair if on a floor, spawns a log if out in the wild. Same effect either way.

RELOAD – Exit Construction Menu

# Scarecrow

An inaminate object come alive, it still can’t move.

It is stationary and can’t move. It can be effected by movement effects. Has more than 1 HP. Enemies in range that move toward it are slowed. It can be picked up by teammates and enemies. Enemies that pick it up are no longer slowed.

LMB – Crow. There’s a crow that sits on his shoulder. Press to send it to the target location. Press again to change which location to send it to. When it gets to its location, it pecks twice, dealing 1 HP damage with each peck. Then it flies to the most recent location. Once in flight, it locks in the location it goes to next. When no location is next, it flies back to you.

RMB – Dark cloud. Hold to form a dark cloud that follows your cursor at a constant rate. Enemies in the dark cloud are nearsighted, meaning they can only see a limited range in front of them. When you release, the dark cloud fades over time. Pressing again rejuvenates the existing dark cloud if it hasn’t dissipated and calls it to your cursor location (this is so you can’t rapid click to always keep the dark cloud on a particular enemy).

SPACE - Map Marker. Press to make a map marker for all teammates. It calls them to pick you up. If you are picked up, press to make a map marker at the target location for the player that carries you (even if it’s an enemy). It tells them to place you at that location.

# Changeling

This creature is an amorphous blob. Turns into other players’ characters. A lot like Mimic, but this one turns into characters. Does not have to worry about amina in base form.

LMB – Copy Shot (Forward). Shoots a standard shot forward. If it hits an enemy or an ally, copies that player’s character and all abilities, with a full charge of amina.

RMB – Copy Shot (Left & Right). Just like LMB, but shooting both left and right.

SPACE – Copy Shot (Backwards). Just like LMB, but backwards.

Yes, you can shoot in all four directions without worrying about amina. If multiple shots hit a player, the last hit one changes your form and overwrites the previous form.

RELOAD – Return to normal form.

If you run out of amina you return to normal form. If you get stunned while copied and then recover from being stunned, you return to normal form. While transforming back to normal form, you become rooted for a few seconds and can’t attack.

While in copied form, you get all abilities from the copied player.

# Spider

LMB – Bite. Deals 1 HP damage in a melee area in front of it. Enemies hit by it also take 1 HP of poison damage per second until they get stunned or heal to max HP.

RMB – Retract. As long as it has a web strand connected, it retracts back on it. If not, it shoots a webstrand behind it and then retracts back on that.

SPACE – Web spin. Dash forward and create a webstrand in your path. Web strands stick to your original position and its end position follows you until it hits something, then it splits and creates a new web strand to make a bend, if not destroyed. Connects to previous web strand. Enemies can destroy the web strands. Enemies that hit the web strand are rooted until the rooting webstrand is destroyed. You get a mapmarker notification when an enemy walks into a webstrand or when a webstrand is destroyed.

# Ant Queen

Ant Queen orders her ants around the area like in an RTS game. WASD moves the camera, not the Ant Queen. The camera can only go where Ant Queen or one of her ants can see. Worker ants generate food when they deal damage. They bring that food back to her, which she can then spend on making more ants or upgrading ants.

LMB – Select / Order Ant. Click on an ant to single select it. Click+Drag to select all ants in the area. Click on an object, enemy, or location to order the ants to move to that location and/or attack that object/player.

RMB – Upgrade / Create Ant. When you have enough food, you can create a new worker ant by right-clicking the queen. Or you can upgrade an existing ant by right-clicking that ant. If you right-click an empty space or something that is not an ant, it automatically creates a new ant and sends it to that target.

SPACE – Burrow. Makes all selected ant burrow if at least one selected ant is not burrowed. Else, it makes all selected ants unburrow. Burrowed ants just stay in place, but provide vision to the Ant Queen. Burrowed ants are safe and cannot be hit by projectiles. When an ant unburrows, it does 1 damage to things it comes up underneath.

# Eye

The giant floating eye of some unseen entity. I think it’s inspired by Vel’Koz from League of Legends.

PASSIVE – Searing Sight. Cannot move. WASD moves the camera. Enemies in the camera and have line of sight to the Eye take damage over time. Get notification when an enemy approaches you.

LMB – Telekinesis. Click+drag to move selected object around. This ability can move the Eye. Works on player made objects and artifacts. Does not work on players or shots.

RMB – Pedestal. Channel to create a pedestal that artifacts can be placed on. Can be destroyed by enemy shots.

SPACE – Teleport to pedestal in view closest to cursor.

PASSIVE – Ancient Artery. Can sit on pedestal. While on pedestal, the Eye acts as an artifact. Allies deal damage over time to enemy players that are in their camera view and that they have line of sight to.

# Wolf

Inspired by this video I saw today: <https://youtu.be/pLyLErufrVs?t=717>

PASSIVE – Wolf. Base speed faster than most characters. Auto-damages players when it runs into them.

LMB – Howl. Spawns a wolf in a random position off screen. The wolf runs to your position. Howl also recalls the Raven.

RMB – Raven send out. Sends out the Raven in the cursor direction. It flies in a straight line until it finds an enemy player or an artifact. Then it gives you a marker to its location as it flies around the target it found. This also sends your gathered wolves to the target location.

SPACE – Run. Increase movement speed.

# Ranger

Elf archer.

LMB – Bow & Arrow. Hold to charge, release to shoot an arrow. It travels fast enough to be almost impossible to dodge. It has a longer range the more you hold. Enemies see a shot indicator while you charge it. While charging, Ranger’s pointing direction is locked, and movement speed is drastically slowed. Drains amina while charging.

RMB – Enchantment. Enchants himself. Enchant while charging Bow & Arrow to increase the damage of the next shot by 1. Enchant while Leaping to increase movement speed for a short while (or until you reload?). Enchant while standing still to enter stealth. Stealth ends the next time you start charging Bow & Arrow.

SPACE – Leap. Leaps in a direction. Works even while charging Bow & Arrow.

# Gargoyle

Four-legged creature with wings that turns to stone.

PASSIVE – Stone guardian. While petrified, colliding with enemies damages them. Instead of being unable to use abilities while petrified, using any ability unpetrifies it.

LMB – Stone shot. Fast moving shot with low range.

RMB – Petrify. Press to petrify. When getting petrified, max HP is increased, current momentum is conserved (until you hit a solid object). While petrified, cannot use abilities (for most characters).

SPACE – Fly. Hold to fly in the target direction. Fly faster the longer you hold.

# Gorgon

Snake person that turns other players to stone. Gameplay inspired by the Snake arcade game.

PASSIVE – Gorgon visage. Enemy players that are in range, have LoS, and are looking at you get petrified over time. While getting petrified, their Max HP is lowered. If their Max HP reaches 0, they become Petrified and now have 5x their Max HP. While Petrified, they can’t move or use abilities, but can still Stand (contest the caravan). When their HP reaches 0, they lose the Petrified status. When Gorgon petrifies a player, Gorgon gets a map marker.

PASSIVE – Gorgon snake. While not moving, takes 1 damage each second. When contacting Petrified player, deals 100 damage. If Gorgon stuns a player or reduces an object’s HP to 0, they gain a snake segment. When taking damage, a snake segment takes the damage instead.

LMB – Stone vision. Adds Petrifying stacks to all entities in range in front of her. These Petrifying stacks reduce Max HP, and if Max HP reaches 0, the player or object gains the Petrified status effect.

RMB – Snake segment. Hold to add a snake segment to yourself. Costs a lot of amina and takes longer than most hold-to-charge abilities. Each snake segment also has the Gorgon Visage passive.

SPACE – Slither. Hold to boost movement speed. When released, it decreased movement speed for a short duration.

# Dredge

In game, it will be all jumbled up and change periodically like a glitch. Inspired by a video I watched about Secret of NIMH after I finished watching the movie.

PASSIVE – Monster. The “movement North” of your character rotates around him at a constant rate, making movement difficult but possible. You take 1 damage for each player (ally or enemy) in a short range around you each second. Leave a trail of dredge behind you. Dredge slows allies and enemies, including you. Standing in dredge recharges your amina over time. Any shot or object that passes through you increases your Max HP, your size (up to a max), refreshes your amina; turns black, and creates a dredge blob when it dies. If you die, you lose your Max HP.

LMB – Dredge throw. After a delay, spawn a dredge blob at the location of the player closest to you.

RMB – Creep. Hold to make dredge blobs creep closer to you. They move very slowly. They stop when they contact another dredge blob, but pass through other objects and players.

SPACE – “Chase”. Move towards the player closest to you.

# Ignoramus

Inspired by Soldier: 76 from Overwatch.

PASSIVE – In Shape. After moving for 1 second, double movement speed.

LMB – Visor Hitscan. Auto-locks onto the object nearest to the cursor. Does not lock onto players, but can damage players. Pretty fast fire rate, but less than 1 damage per shot. If there’s no objects around, it doesn’t fire.

RMB – Rockets. Shoot 3 rockets that travel at regular player movement speed. Has a (relatively) long cooldown. Doesn’t consume amina.

SPACE – Heal aura. Drop a shot that heals allies over time in an AoE. Self-destructs after a few seconds. Does not have a cooldown, costs amina.

# Gardener

This character likes plants and growing them.

LMB – Thorn Bush. Shoot a seed that acts like a normal shot. When it reaches its target position, it grows a thorn bush. When a player collides with a Thorn Bush, they consume a thorn to take 1 damage.

RMB – Herb Bush. Shoot a seed. When it reaches its target position, it grows a herb bush. When a player collides with a Herb Bush, they consume a herb to heal 1 HP.

SPACE – Rainbow Bush. Shoot a seed. When it reaches its target position, it grows a rainbow bush. When a player collies with a Rainbow Bush, they consume a rainbow to gain a temporary movement speed boost.

# Troll

Antimagic tank.

PASSIVE – Thick Skin. Has the Immune status effect (cannot gain any other status effect). Has a high base Max HP. Is larger than most characters. Cannot gain buffs or debuffs. Cannot be displaced by boops. Slightly slower than most characters.

LMB – Club. After a delay, slam his club down in a line in the target direction. Can move while slamming it.

RMB – Stomp. Hold while moving. Enemies in a short radius around you lose all amina. Deal 1 damage to objects in the radius.

SPACE – Heal. Heals 1 HP.

# Librarian

Finds books and takes them to the library. Character inspired by a mix of Moira from Overwatch and Ms. Frizzle from Magic Schoolbus.

PASSIVE – Librarian. Has books in 4 different topics, which correspond to each of the 4 skill upgrades (shoot, stand, scout, spot). Any other player can come to her library to checkout up to 4 books. The player can carry them like Artifacts, and they can be stolen and dropped like Artifacts. Each book has a “due date”, which is probably about 1 minute. If a book becomes over due, it will turn the player’s skill upgrades into books once every 10 seconds until the books are returned. This is how the library gains new books. If a player that has checked out books enters the library, they will auto-return the books. Thus, players can change which books they have checked out by exiting and entering the library.

LMB – Fine shot. A shot that is a fine. Does 1 damage. If it hits a player that has an overdue book, it will deal 100 damage to them (even if that player is a teammate). Thus, this is a very good tool to get overdue books back, because stunning a player makes them drop books (but simply damaging a player does not).

RMB – Create door to player with highest due book number. Factors used to calculate “due book number” include number of books, how long a book has been overdue, and how close it is being due (if not overdue). If the player leaves the limited range of the door, or this ability gets activated again, the door is destroyed. This door can be used to teleport to the library and/or from the library to the location.

SPACE – Teleport to Library. Leaves behind a door that other players can use to teleport to the library.

RELOAD – (in addition to actually reloading) Place Library. Only happens once per game. You become invincible for a short duration while you wait for the Library to spawn. The library respawns in a square area around you, dealing 100 damage to all objects and players in the area as it spawns in.

# House Cat

Change name later, but basically a small cat. Follows teammates around and purrs.

PASSIVE – Purr. While near a teammate, purr. Purring heals you and nearby teammates overtime.

LMB – Meow. Create a map marker at your cursor visible to teammates. While purring, instantly heal 1 hp to nearby allies.

RMB – Crouch (& Pounce). Hold to root yourself and charge the Crouch. When released, jump to a position at the cursor (if in range). Holding the crouch extends the range. Deal 1 damage to anything you hit during the jump. When you land, deal 1 damage to objects in the radius, and set the velocity of all RigidBody2Ds in the area to 0, including shots.

SPACE – Run. Hold to increase movement speed.

# Deer

Just a really intelligent deer. Possibly inspired by Charlie, a deer from a story I wrote, and/or Valt the Wonder Deer, even though that show is plastic. Is an adult male deer with antlers.

PASSIVE – Herd leader. Teammates get a map marker at your location at all times.

LMB – Quad Shot. Shoots four shots from its antlers in the target direction.

RMB – Antlers. Shoots an antler-shaped shot in the target direction. It is wide, and blocks shots it contacts. It deals damage to objects and shots, but not players. If it hits a player, it pushes them in its moving direction. It damages player-made objects but not environment objects. It heals plants it passes through, and allies it passes through.

SPACE – Bound. Press to jump from your current position to a position in the movement direction.

# Paladin

Heals teammates by doing damage. Loosely inspired by Brigitte from Overwatch.

PASSIVE – Shield dance. Dealing damage heals 1 hp to all shields. When a shield takes damage, the player it protects gets healed 1 hp. Shield only cover 1 side of the player they protect.

LMB – Sword shot. Has 2 hp. Heals itself when it deals damage, allowing it to pass through multiple enemies.

RMB – Shield shot. A semi-wide shot with at least 2 Max HP that blocks other shots. If it contacts an ally, it locks onto them. You control the direction of the shield (like Dwarf controls his turrets).

SPACE – Shield Bash. Gain / refresh your own shield. Lunge forward a fixed distance towards the cursor. Enemy players you hit with your shield get displaced in your movement direction, but take no damage.

# Astrologer

Studies the stars and summons minor celestial bodies. Maybe it needs renamed.

LMB – Meteor shot. Summons meteorites in a line, starting at his position. Each meteorite deals 1 damage, and does not have a delay before dropping, but has a fixed amount of time before dropping after the last one dropped (simulates having a moving shot, but with multiple dropped shots).

RMB – Sun laser. Hold to charge a sun laser. Release to spawn a ball of light that makes the laser. You can move around while charging and after the ball gets spawned. The laser deals damage over time to the first object or player it hits. It’s a high damage per second.

SPACE – Moon rock. Spawns two moon rocks, one with the flat side facing in, one in the opposite side of you with the flat side facing out . Lasers that hit the flat side get reflected. Lasers that hit the round side get absorbed. Works on the Sun Laser and lasers from other players. Lasers cannot destroy the moon rocks.

# Lost Spirit

A spirit that is lost and confused, trying to find its body.

PASSIVE – Etheral. Has the Ethereal status effect. Cannot be damaged. Cannot pick up artifacts or items.

PASSIVE – Controller. When it presses LMB, RMB, SPACE, or RELOAD, it forces any player it is in contact with to also press that button. When not pressing any buttons, it causes the player to move in the WASD movement direction its pressing. Cannot deal damage or receive damage. If a player dies (without being stunned) while you are in contact with them, you become that character for the rest of the game.

LMB – Press LMB.

RMB – Press RMB.

SPACE – Press SPACE.

RELOAD – Press RELOAD.

# Road Builder

Builds roads. Probably won’t be implemented, but there’s a possibility. The main idea is that it changes the route the caravan takes.

PASSIVE – Roadmap. Can see the official path of the caravan glowing.

LMB – Add road piece.

RMB – Remove road piece. Cannot remove road pieces on the official path.

SPACE – Road closed sign. Blocks shots. Used to try to push the official path off of one route and onto another one.

# Carrier

Inspired by the COVID pandemic (and response to it (or lack thereof)). A very sick person.

PASSIVE – Contagious. If they try to use an ability but don’t have enough amina, the rest of the amina will be consumed to cough or sneeze. All players in the cough or sneeze area of effect will contract the Contagious passive. Players with the Contagious passive have the Poisoned and Fatigued status effects applied to them. Players can spread it to teammates. Contagious lasts for a few minutes, but can be refreshed if contracted again. If you leave the game with Contagious, it sticks on that character and carries into the next game you play with that character. However, if you wait enough time before playing that character again, the passive will wear off. If a player with Contagious doesn’t have the Poisoned or Fatigued status effects, Contagious reapplies them.

LMB – Shout. If succeeds, nearby teammates receive some amina. All nearby players contract a carried disease.

RMB – Think. If succeeds, Carrier puts on a mask that drastically reduces the area of effect of the Contagious passive (to basically nothing). Carrier also gains a 1 HP shield.

SPACE – Flail arms. If succeeds, nearby shots take 1 damage.

# Virologist

Researches how to stop diseases.

PASSIVE – Vaccinated. Cannot contract the Contagious passive, and cannot gain Poisoned or Fatigued.

LMB – Vaccine shot. Heals allies 1 HP, damages enemies 1 HP. Any player hit by it also gains the Vaccinated passive.

RMB – Quarantine. Click on a player with Contagious to spawn a gravity zone that aggressively sucks anyone with the Contagious passive in. It also works on players with the Poisoned or Fatigued status effect. When there are no players in it with the given passive or status effects, the Quarantine pull zone dissipates.

SPACE – Sanitation Bubble. Makes a bubble in an area around him. All players hit by the bubble lose all negative status effects and can’t gain negative status effects for 1 seconds.

# Robin Hood

Everyone knows the story of Robin Hood. This is basically just a copy of that.

PASSIVE – Curved arrows. His arrows curve toward the cursor’s location.

PASSIVE – Pick pocket. If you contact an enemy, steal a skill point.

LMB – Arrow. Shoots an arrow. As it travels, it curves towards the cursor.

RMB – Roped Arrow. Shoots an arrow with a rope attached. Allies traveling along the rope get pulled quickly toward the end of the rope. The rope end points get set when the arrow hits something.

SPACE – Hop. Press to hop a short distance.

LMB – Curve Arrow Left. Curves an arrow left. The arrow spawns so that when it curves, it still passes through the location at the cursor.

RMB – Curve Arrow Right. Curves an arrow right. The arrow spawns so that when it curves, it still passes trough the location at the cursor.

# Ogre

A large creature that can deny magic use. Inspired by Shrek.

PASSIVE – Ogre. Has 3 Max HP. Contacting wild animals (like frogs) lets you eat them to heal 1 HP and restore 25 amina. Contacting an enemy player inside your swamp lets you deal 1 damage to them, and heals you 1 HP and restores 25 amina.

LMB – Mud fling. Flings a large slow-moving shot. The next shot after eating instead flings 3 large slow-moving shots, and the extra two get shot at an angle.

RMB – Fart. Release a stink cloud behind you. It moves slowly. Enemies inside get Fatigued. After eating a wild animal, the next RMB is a burp instead. Burp in front, and all enemies in a range in front of you instantly lose all amina.

SPACE – Swamp (Antimagic field). Press and hold to create a swamp at your feet. Players inside the swamp get Fatigued (drain amina over time). Frogs spawn periodically in the swamp. Enemies in the swamp are also slightly slowed.

# Lightning Sprite

Based on Zeri from League of Legends. I really like Zeri’s Q so that’s why I’m writing this character idea down.

LMB – Rapid Fire. Shoots projectile shots with fast fire rate and fast shot movement speed. However, the shots never go directly where you aim, but always a few degrees left or right, and they alternate left and right. They also have limited range.

RMB – Lightning Strike. After a short delay, make lightning strike in the target direction. Has limited range, but extends beyond what you can see. If you hit an enemy, you steal all their amina. If you don’t hit any enemies, you lose all your amina. Does no damage.

SPACE – Thunder Zone. Press to create a wide circular area surrounded by an electric ring. Enemies in this area drain amina over time and it goes to you. While in the Thunder Zone, press again to teleport to the furthest edge of the zone in the movement direction. While not inside a zone, it shrinks over time. When a new Thunder Zone is created, it expands over time to its max range, as long as you’re in it.

# Flashy

Based on Leshy from Inscryption. Turns living creatures into cards by taking pictures of them.

Ok this character is going to be ridiculously broken and/or barely playable. But it’s okay, because there are going to be joke characters in this game, and this might be one of them. This character will probably also be really hard to find to unlock.

PASSIVE – Card collector. Cards collected remain owned until they die, even between games. Conversely, cards that die, die for good. Has 5 Max HP.

*Cabin*

LMB – Camera. Use all amina to take a picture. Target closest to camera and in line of sight gets turned into a card, with Max HP as health points and current amina as attack damage. Flashy can walk over it to collect it. If he doesn’t collect it within the time limit, the target turns back into its original form. Works on players, trees, wild animals. Also, it has to last hit the target. The flash deals 1 damage, but if the target is below 10 hp, it deals 10 damage instead. If the target dies, it gets turned into a card instead. If a player gets stunned, it does not turn into a card (i.e. if the player has immortal, that player is not turned into a card). Consumes 1 stack of film.

RMB – Roll of Film. Spawns a roll of film instantly at max range in the target direction. The player to collect it gets 100 amina and 1 stack of film.

SPACE – Card Table. Instantly spawns a table in the target direction. The first enemy player to step in its area activates it. If Flashy moves before the table is activated, it disappears.

*Table*

This is the set of controls used when Flashy is at a table with an opponent. When the table is activated, Flashy is healed to full. If the opponent is below 5 HP, the opponent is healed to 5 HP (if possible). Flashy’s amina and the opponent’s amina are both set to 100, if below 100. The opponent’s abilities are turned into cards, and placed into a deck with infinite cards. When the opponent needs to draw a card, they randomly draw one of their abilities. Each card has an amina cost, a health stat, and an attack stat, which is pulled from the ability’s actual stats. If it has no hp at all (like Sniper laser), then it dies at the end of the turn. Dealing damage in the card game heals you for the amount you dealt, and same for your opponent. Healing yourself also deals damage to the opponent, and vice versa.

The following controls apply to Flashy. He has a max of 3 cards in front of him, and his deck is finite. But his cards have no amina cost. Flashy plays first and twice but cannot attack in his two turns.

LMB – Play card 1 at the target location.

RMB – Play card 2 at the target location.

SPACE – Play card 3 at the target location.

RELOAD – End turn early.

The following controls apply to Flashy’s opponent. Their deck is infinite but their cards cost amina.

LMB – Play an LMB card (if in hand).

RMB – Play an RMB card (if in hand).

SPACE – Play a SPACE card (if in hand).

RELOAD – End turn early.

At the end of each player’s turn, their cards attack. There are four lanes and the rules are pretty much straight out of Inscryption.

The card game ends when one player’s HP goes to 0. If Flashy wins, then his opponent gets turned into a card and gets kicked out of the game (there’s no coming back from being cardified). If the opponent wins, then they stun Flashy, and heal to full Max HP and gain 100 amina.

During the game, if Flashy or his opponent would take damage from outside the game, they instead teleport a short distance towards the furthest team flag from their location. Both players can Stand (push the caravan) during the card game.

Yes, opponents are allowed to enter the game with more than 5 HP, if they had more when they entered because of their Max HP.

Flashy’s cards have a 1 turn delay, which lets his opponents see which cards he’s about to play. This is why he takes the first two turns.

There is a timer that automatically ends a player’s turn if they don’t know to press RELOAD to end it. No matter whether a player ended it early or the turn ended by the timer, that player’s cards attack at the end of the turn.

Man this is going to be so hard to program. Having to turn all the characters’ abilities into cards is not going to be easy. And then you have to change each player’s button controls on the fly to fit the game. How do you convert abilities like Astral dash and Unicorn rainbow path? Also, would Astral have 5 cards? LMB, SPACE, and 3 for the RMB menu? Could you charge up abilities like Unicorn carried shot and Arsenal barrage? This might be easier once the abilities use some kind of rules language and you can construct an entire character in the editor without needing to go into the code.

# RailGun

A guy with a rail gun.

2022-02-17: Addendum: might make this character the child of the Unicorn, and the railgun part is a really long rainbow.

LMB – Standard shot. 2 HP, has limited range.

RMB – Rail Gun. Instantly place a rail gun lane in the target direction, that stretches half way across the map. Ally shots inside get double movement speed, and get healed over time (thus extending their range). Works on all ally shots, including RailGun’s LMB and SPACE shots. Rail Gun passively throws electric static down its lane, which steals amina from enemies that it hits. Rail Guns last until he reloads.

SPACE – Shot Bubble. Surround yourself in a bubble that is also a shot. It carries you as it travels until it breaks. You cannot get out of it any other way.

# Paper Bird

A piece of paper that has been folded into a little bird. Secretly is the trapped God of Wind.

PASSIVE – Ninja. While stealthed, gain double movement speed.

RMB – Bind Spell. Fast traveling big shot that does no damage, but applies the Bindable passive to the first player or object it hits. An entity loses Bindable if it dies. If a player with Bindable collides with an object with Bindable, that player gets sealed into that object, and both player and object lose Bindable. That player gains the Sealed passive. A player with the Sealed passive looks like the object it was sealed into, cannot move, but can still use abilities, to an extent.

SPACE – Compel. Forces players with Bindable to move away from him.

# Water Sprite

Heals and cleanses. Nullifies enemy passives.

# Phaser

Phases in and out of reality.

PASSIVE – Phasing. Every second, he and his shots phase in and out of reality. They gain Ethereal if they don’t have it, and lose Ethereal if they have it. This happens once a second.

LMB – Standard Shot. Just a standard shot, but because of his passive, it phases in and out reality.

RMB – Homing Shot. A shot that moves slower but tracks towards his cursor.

SPACE – Stabilize. Hold to pause his passive. Upon release, his passive reactivates and switches immediately.

# Dwarf King

The King of the Dwarves. Possibly named Dawner Triumph.

PASSIVE – Throne sitter. Spawns in sitting on a throne. Has Silenced while not on the throne. The throne can be moved if at least 4 other players are in range, and then the throne moves the average velocity of the other players. If a teammate in the outer range gains wanted meter, Dwarf King gains it instead. If you don’t have full amina, you siphen it from players in the outer range over time. Additionally, if there are players in the outer range with amina, you use their amina first before using your own.  
NOTE: Using WASD will make him walk off the throne, not move the camera. Meaning that your LMB is limited to what you can see in your immediate area.

LMB – Move command. Makes a map marker for your team at the target location. If placed on an enemy, it instead becomes an attack command.

RMB – Summon. Press to shoot a summon shot. This summon shot moves through objects and other shots. If it passes by any player, you get a map marker to that player while they’re in range of the shot. When it hits a player, that player gets a summon chain attached to them. When a player with a summon chain gets Stunned, they lose Stunned, gain Ethereal, and are pulled into the inner range of the Dwarf King, then lose Ethereal.

SPACE – Punish. Click on a player outside your inner range who is moving away from you. That player takes 1 damage.

Yes, it’s meant to be oppressive, to both teammates and enemies, while providing hardly any value. That’s the point.

LMB – Launch. Press to launch the shot that is closest to the target location towards the target location.

RMB – Fire spread. Shoot a shot in the target direction from every object that is on fire.

# Candyman

Leaves candy everywhere. I’m imagining a candy version of Ivern from League of Legends.

PASSIVE – Candy Trail. While moving around, leaves behind a trail of candy. Each piece of candy grants 10 amina to the player that picks it up. Candyman can’t pick up candy. The candy gives players the Sweet passive until they reload.

LMB – Candy Cane. Pokes candy cane forward. If it hits a player, it damages them and pulls them to him.

SPACE – Powdered Sugar. Press to spray powdered sugar in the target direction. Any player, object, or shot in the area of effect gains the Sweet passive. Shots in the AoE get their damage halved.

# Doe

A female deer. Heavily inspired by Lillia from League of Legends. I’m basically CTRL+C, CTRL+V’ing her into this game.

SPACE – Leap. Leap in target direction. Upon landing, deal 1 damage to enemy players in a small radius.

# Jailer

LMB – Surround shot. Shoots a standard shot, but when it gets to its target location, it spawns a whole bunch of shots in a circle pattern, that encloses in an area. These shots are stationary and last until destroyed. They all do 1 damage like normal.

RMB – Jail. After a delay, spawn a circle jail. If an enemy player stays in the circle for 1 second or gets stunned while in the circle, they gain the Jailed passive. If there are no players in the circle for 5 seconds, the circle disappears.

SPACE – Capture. Press to make all shots you control move towards the target position.

PASSIVE – Jailed. If a player with Jailed is not in a jail circle, after 1 second, they gain Silenced and Immobile and are dragged back to the closest empty jail circle, then lose Silenced and Immobile. If there are no empty Jail circles, they lose Jailed. If a teammate without Jailed touches this player, this player loses Jailed, and if they are standing in a jail circle, the circle is destroyed.

# God of Earth

Causes earthquakes.

PASSIVE – Grounded. Cannot be forcefully moved. Cannot gain Airborne.

LMB – Mountainize. After a delay, spawn a thick rock pillar that damages players and objects under it when it spawns. It has a high Max HP.

# Thunder Mech

A big mech with lots of health. Cannot gain amina normally. Has lots of damage output. All abilities drain amina really quickly.

PASSIVE – Failing battery. Cannot reload normally. Amina drains over time. Hold RELOAD to steal amina over time from objects and players in a wide radius. Can use while using other abilities.

LMB – Shot spread. Shoots lots of shots in the front, and a good amount in all directions. Uses up all remaining amina, so number of shots is based on the remaining amina.

RMB – Laser. Hold to shoot a laser. It starts off with a small range and over time its range increases. Thunder Mech is locked in place while holding, except it can move forward and backward in the laser target direction. After the laser is released, it loses all amina. Despite being the most hard-hitting attack, it actually drains amina the slowest while active.

SPACE – Boosters. Hold to increase movement speed. The amount increased is a percentage of the amina it has left. It uses up a percentage of the remaining amina each second, draining most of the amina in about 1 second.

# Pandoze

PASSIVE – Stone Armor. If he gains Petrified, he can still move and use abilities.

LMB – Dirt Rock. Throw a dirt rock. When it reaches its target location, it explodes into 8 small shots with a short range.

RMB – Stone Punch. Press to deal 1 damage to players and objects in a small area in front of you. It also punches the object or player in the target direction and causes it to move like a shot and deal damage to the first thing it hits.

SPACE – Stone Cage. After a delay, spawn a rock at the target position. If a player is in it, it gives them Petrified, ally or enemy. If nothing is in it, it spawns a rock object (that can be punched with RMB).

# Projector

Inspired by playing laser pointer with my cats (which are actually my sister’s). A large thing that projects an image that he manipulates. The projector has higher than average HP.

PASSIVE – Projection. Has a projection that does not do anything, is just visual effects. Using the projection’s “abilities” costs no amina. The projection is not affected by collisions of any kind. This actually isn’t really a passive, it just describes the behaviour of the projection.

LMB – Standard Shot. Shoot a standard shot from the projector or the projection, whichever is controlled. Shots from the projection don’t do any damage but shoot really slow.

RMB – Teleport. Teleport the projection to the target location, even if the projector is one being controlled. The projection then copies the form of the closest player to it. It also copies the LMB ability of the player it copied. If there is no projection, it creates one.

SPACE – Switch to projection. If controlling the projection, switch to projector. If controlling the projector, switch to the projection. The one getting controlled has the camera view and is controlled by the WASD keys.

# Frog

Regular frog that likes to eat things from far away. Now that I think about it, this character might play a little bit like Tahm Kench from League of Legends, tho I don’t think its inspired by that champion.

LMB – Tongue. Press and hold to shoot the tongue. It travels as long as you hold it. When you release, it pulls back to quickly return to your mouth. If the tongue hits an enemy player or object, it pulls back automatically. It damages enemy players and objects it hits. It pulls in enemy shots that it hits, which it then eats. For each enemy shot eaten, Frog heals and recharges amina. It also stores a stack of shots it ate. Also, the tongue works on artifacts as well. Only the tip of the tongue has collision, meaning the middle part can go through players, objects, and shots.

RMB – Ribbit. If there are shots on the stack, pop off the first one and shoot it in the target direction.

SPACE – Jump. Hold and release to jump in the movement direction. The more you hold, the further you go.

# Puppet Master

Turns players into puppets by grappling them with strings.

LMB – Stringify. Press to shoot a string shot. If it hits an enemy player or object, it attaches. Puppet Master gradually takes control of a player when he attaches strings to them. First string: the controlled player presses LMB when Puppet Master does, Second string: RMB, Third: SPACE, Fourth: RELOAD, Fifth (the final string): WASD. When the Puppet Master gets 5 strings on a player, that player is completely under the control of the Puppet Master, and all shots and abilities used get aligned with his team. He takes complete control of enemy objects after attaching only two strings to the object. When Puppet Master dies (gets stunned), all his strings detach and break.

RMB – Exert Control. Hold to exert control on players and objects he has strings on. If those players and/or objects are not moving in his movement direction, they are slowed.

SPACE – Allegro. Hold to increase move speed. Players and objects he has strings on also get the speed boost if they are moving in the same direction.

# Leftop

Based on a creature I made when I was a kid for a card game called Creature Combat. I intend on updating the name to something more interesting.

## On Ground

LMB – Sting. Shoot a sting shot behind you (opposite the target direction). It deals 1 damage on contact and applies Poisoned.

RMB – Laser Shield. Hold to make a laser shield. It surrounds you and a small area around you. It deals 10 damage to any shot that contacts it. It has a weakness: it doesn’t stop stops in a small cone in the front.

## In Air

LMB – Sting. If you are carrying an enemy, deal 1 damage to them and give them Poisoned. If not, spawn a sting shot behind you that shoots forward.

RMB – Drop. If you are carrying an enemy, drop them where you are. If not, deal 1 damage to Airborne enemies near you and remove their Airborne status.

SPACE – Fly. Hold to keep flying. Release to go back to the ground. If you are holding an enemy, stop giving them Airborne and Immobile.

# Track Layer

Places a train track on the ground that can be used for mine carts.

When he spawns in, the last rail point is his spawn position.

PASSIVE – Railway. He has a last rail point, which is used to build rails from. He can build rails, switches, and dead end spots. When a switch is shot by anything, it changes the direction the rail goes. When a dead end spot is shot, it creates a minecart that travels from the dead end spot along the rail. When a minecart arrives at a dead end spot, it is destroyed. When a minecart collides with a dead end spot, both minecarts are destroyed. Players, shots, and objects that collide with a minecart are pulled along its path, allowing them to ride the minecart without being forced to.

LMB – Trigger shot. Standard shot. Triggers switches and dead end spots like all shots do.

RMB – Place switch. Press on an existing track to place a switch and set it as your last rail point. This switch can be triggered by any player by shooting at it. It rotates between the available tracks to determine which direction a minecart will go when coming to the intersection. If you press on an area where there is no track, it creates a dead end spot and becomes your last rail point anyway. Clicking on an existing switch and/or dead end spot makes that already existing switch / dead end spot the last rail point.

SPACE – Place rails. Lay rails from the last rail point to your current position. Your current position then becomes the last rail point. The rail builds over a few seconds to your current location. Anything in the way takes damage.

# Armadillo

I played Rammus in League of Legends today and so that’s what’s on my mind. I guess it’s also inspired by Wrecking Ball from Overwatch? Because I think these two characters are very similar in concept.

LMB – Quill Shot. Three thin shots that move quicker than standard shots. Switches its lean from left to right and back every time it shoots.

RMB – Shield. Press to gain a shield that tanks 1 shot.

SPACE – Roll. Hold to roll and move faster. LMB becomes a burst of radial shots during roll. RMB during roll takes control of nearby shots and redirects them away from him.

# Poison Bird

A bird that shoots poison darts.

LMB – Dart. Smaller shot but faster.

RMB – Poison Fling. A short-ranged fast shot that deals 1 damage and inflicts Poisoned to enemy players it hits. Any shot that contacts it also inflicts Poisoned.

SPACE – Fly. Hold to gain Airborne, release to lose Airborne. Cannot change direction while Airborne.

# Drone Friend

2023-12-28: A guy and a flying orb drone friend. Inspired by Orianna and Ezreal from League of Legends.

The orb stays in the same position relative to the guy as he moves around. The orb and the guy can be stunned separately.

LMB – Rapid Fire. Fires small fast-moving projectiles both from the guy and the orb at the target location.

RMB – Reposition. The orb moves to the target location, relative to the guy.

SPACE – Swap. The orb and the guy swap positions.

PASSIVE – Amina Shield. The orb has the amina meter instead of the guy’s cursor. The amina meter is the orb’s shield, pointing in the direction the orb is firing. If the shield takes damage, amina is used to block the damage from the shot.

# Abyssal Minotaur

2023-12-28: A minotaur chained to the underworld. Inspired by Orianna from League of Legends, and Zannacore, a character I made for D&D, who was inspired by Warwick and Alistar from League of Legends. Also inspired by Aatrox from League of Legends.

The minotaur is chained to a spiky ball that is stuck in one position. The minotaur cannot move beyond the range of the spiky ball, nor can he be forcibly moved from its range. If the spiky ball is forcibly moved, it pulls the minotaur with it. The spiky ball is immune to damage. The spiky ball deals damage to anything that touches it, whether moving or stationary.

If the minotaur is teleported outside the range of the spiky ball, he is released from the chain, and can no longer control it. His LMB is then replaced with Rock Throw. This is a persistent change for this player’s abyssal minotaur. The minotaur’s spiky ball remains in the place it was dropped. He can pick it up if he gets within range of it. If he does, it reattaches to him, trapping him again.

LMB - Chain pull. The minotaur pulls the chain, causing the spiky ball to move to the target position, doing damage to heroes and objects in its path.

LMB – Rock Throw. The minotaur throws a rock the size of the spiky ball to the target location.

RMB – Head butt. The minotaur head butts projectiles in a small radius around it towards the target direction. Works on enemy projectiles and his spiky ball.

SPACE – Charge. The minotaur gains movement speed but can’t change direction. It knocks back players and objects it runs into. Can knockback his spiky ball.

PASSIVE – Antimagic Field. While stationary, the spiky ball creates an ever-growing antimagic field. This antimagic field prevents players from gaining amina while inside it. The antimagic field steadily shrinks while the spiky ball is not in it.
