Requirements:

Requirements end with a question mark ("?")
Consecutive requirements will say true or false, and then if all are true, then they will do the update part of their task, and the block will continue
cooldown and spend are common requirements that appear next to each other.
Put a ! in front of the ? to say "not"

fails: if mana locked (this happens commonly during reload)
passes: if there's more than 0 mana (allows partial)
passes: if disallowPartial and there's [mana cost] mana or more
